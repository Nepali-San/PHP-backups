1) Difference between print and echo.
=> The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

2) var_dump($variable)
=> This functions returns the datatype and value of $variable.

3) Arrays
=> In PHP, there are three types of arrays:
Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index
Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys
Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays

4) DataTypes
=> PHP supports the following data types:
String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
