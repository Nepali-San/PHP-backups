(1, 'Nine Practices to Create a Joyful Mind', 'Ayurveda_And_Yogic_Science', 'In yoga philosophy, we speak about consciousness. We refer to yogic texts that offer practices to help us raise our awareness and become more present.', 'In yoga philosophy, we speak about consciousness. We refer to yogic texts that offer practices to help us raise our awareness and become more present. This certainly sounds like a good idea, and it really doesn\'t seem too tough. It just requires some time and effort, along with the ability to remain stillâ€”all low-cost and easily accessible requirements. So why isn\'t everyone feeling the bliss on the awareness-raising, higher-consciousness train of joy?   Our minds need to buy into the whole operation. The yoga and ayurvedic texts tell us that our nature is sattva, or clarity and balance; our mind is essentially joy. This can be a challenging concept. After all, it may not feel like your mindâ€™s nature is joy!   The biological model tells us that our brainâ€™s number one job is to keep the organism (thatâ€™s you) alive. Often the behaviors we engage in to survive feel less than joyful. Sometimes the desire for happiness and the need to stay alive feel at odds. This is where we begin to sacrifice our need for joy and focus more of our precious energy and attention on staying alive.  Sometimes the desire for happiness and the need to stay alive feel at odds. These two agendas do not have to be separated. Through our yoga practices, we can develop support for our survival, building adaptability and resilience while establishing an awareness of our essential joy. For example, when I practice deep relaxation (which feels pretty blissful), I am also supporting my nervous system (resiliency) and cultivating an energy reserve that will help me navigate change without fatigue (adaptability). In ayurvedic practices, the daily routine (dinacharya) offers us a way to start each day with the same self-supporting practicesâ€”rising with gratitude, tongue scraping, drinking warm water with lemon, belly-breathing practices, and body oiling before bathing. This daily routine provides an anchor of support, helping us to develop adaptability and resilience by decreasing decision fatigue, as we know what to expect. This provides a solid foundation on which to build every morning, allowing us to approach each day with less stress and more joy!  The purpose of this work is to detach from the limiting and false notion that only who you are in this moment matters. Look at a photo of yourself from 15 years agoâ€”same person? Kinda, but not really.  Whichever school of thought you subscribe toâ€”yoga, ayurveda, Western psychologyâ€”the basic tenets are the same: your mind and body are connected, and they are changeable and filled with infinite potential. What you feed your senses and how well you digest the lessons from past experiences are the keys to creating change in your perceptions of your life moment to moment. If you begin to work with these variables, you can turn the mind to your side.  Easy enough in theory, right? We have all kinds of advice from the Yoga Sutra, Charaka Samhita (a seminal text of ayurveda), attachment theory (John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworthâ€™s model for describing interpersonal relationships), and modern-day psychology about how to include these ideas in our daily lives. Yet when it comes to actually putting this good advice into practice, it seems we have less guidance available on building a joyful, adaptable, and resilient life.  That is what â€œgetting your mind on your sideâ€ is all aboutâ€”getting some space to view your process. This distance allows us more perspective to evaluate the experiences that have created our thought and behavior patterns, which ultimately leads us toward greater understanding and consciousness.  In order to be more adaptable and create a more mindful, spacious day, you need to support your self-regulation with what I call â€œlittle anchors,â€ or routines. Creating a morning routine will go far to support steadiness and ease without the decision fatigue that results from the â€œwake-up chaosâ€ many of us call â€œmorning time.â€ Try including one, two, or three of these easy-to-implement suggestions into a morning routine that will work for your life. Anchors away!   In order to be more adaptable and create a more mindful, spacious day, you need to support your self-regulation with what I call â€œlittle anchors,â€ or routines. Nine Simple (but Sometimes Challenging) Practices to Create Healthful Mind Patterns  1. Get up at dawn.  2. Establish a daily cleansing and nurturing routine (dinacharya).  3. Allow yourself the time needed to evacuate wastes fully every morning. Rushing hinders the process!  4. Eat nourishing meals, cooked with nourishing oils, three times a day.  5. Practice deep relaxation or meditation, or walk quietly in nature.  6. Go to bed at the same time almost every night (preferably between 10 and 11 p.m.).  7. Move your body enough to break a light sweat every day.  8. Offer gratitude to something greater than yourselfâ€”for your life and for the people and things that are most important to you.  9. Become aware of your heart\'s desire and your innate passion, and explore those impulses!  These are the go-to practices that help me keep my mind on my side. As we build mental impressions (samskaras) around these daily actions, we bring more prana (life force), tejas (discrimination), and ojas (deep vitality) to our lives. We start to create new neural grooves or patterns in our brains, which will feed our minds in moving slowly and steadily toward clarity and balanceâ€”and, ultimately, toward joy.', '9practises.jpg', 1, 'nine-practises-to-create-joyful-mind', 1, 'Yogi Pratap', '2017-09-03 11:41:47', NULL, NULL),
(5, 'Vipasana-For Mental  Peace', 'Ayurveda_And_Yogic_Science', 'Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are, is one of most ancient techniques of meditation. It was rediscovered by', 'Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are, is one of India\'s most ancient techniques of meditation. It was rediscovered by Gotama Buddha more than 2500 years ago and was taught by him as a universal remedy for universal ills, i.e., an Art Of Living. This non-sectarian technique aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation.  Vipassana is a way of self-transformation through self-observation. It focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind. It is this observation-based, self-exploratory journey to the common root of mind and body that dissolves mental impurity, resulting in a balanced mind full of love and compassion.  The scientific laws that operate one\'s thoughts, feelings, judgements and sensations become clear. Through direct experience, the nature of how one grows or regresses, how one produces suffering or frees oneself from suffering is understood. Life becomes characterized by increased awareness, non-delusion, self-control and peace.  The Tradition  Since the time of Buddha, Vipassana has been handed down, to the present day, by an unbroken chain of teachers. Although Indian by descent, the current teacher in this chain, Mr. S.N. Goenka, was born and raised in Burma (Myanmar). While living there he had the good fortune to learn Vipassana from his teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin who was at the time a high Government official. After receiving training from his teacher for fourteen years, Mr. Goenka settled in India and began teaching Vipassana in 1969. Since then he has taught tens of thousands of people of all races and all religions in both the East and West. In 1982 he began to appoint assistant teachers to help him meet the growing demand for Vipassana courses.', 'vipasana.jpg', 1, 'vipasana', 1, 'Yogi Pratap', '2017-09-01 16:30:20', NULL, NULL),

(12, 'The Mental Health Benefits of Exercise', 'Exercises_And_Diet', 'Everyone knows that regular exercise is good for the body. But exercise is also one of the most effective ways to improve your mental health. Regular ', 'Everyone knows that regular exercise is good for the body. But exercise is also one of the most effective ways to improve your mental health. Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, ADHD, and more. It also relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts overall mood. And you donâ€™t have to be a fitness fanatic to reap the benefits. Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a difference. No matter your age or fitness level, you can learn to use exercise as a powerful tool to feel better.  What are the mental health benefits of exercise? Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure, exercise can improve your physical health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to your life. But thatâ€™s not what motivates most people to stay active.  People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and their lives. And itâ€™s also powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.  Exercise and depression  Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medicationâ€”but without the side-effects, of course. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.  Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.  Exercise and anxiety  Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Anything that gets you moving can help, but youâ€™ll get a bigger benefit if you pay attention instead of zoning out.  Try to notice the sensation of your feet hitting the ground, for example, or the rhythm of your breathing, or the feeling of the wind on your skin. By adding this mindfulness elementâ€”really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exerciseâ€”youâ€™ll not only improve your physical condition faster, but you may also be able to interrupt the flow of constant worries running through your head.  Exercise and stress  Ever noticed how your body feels when youâ€™re under stress? Your muscles may be tense, especially in your face, neck, and shoulders, leaving you with back or neck pain, or painful headaches. You may feel a tightness in your chest, a pounding pulse, or muscle cramps. You may also experience problems such as insomnia, heartburn, stomachache, diarrhea, or frequent urination. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even more stress, creating a vicious cycle between your mind and body.  Exercising is an effective way to break this cycle. As well as releasing endorphins in the brain, physical activity helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body. Since the body and mind are so closely linked, when your body feels better so, too, will your mind.  Exercise and ADHD  Exercising regularly is one of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce the symptoms of ADHD and improve concentration, motivation, memory, and mood. Physical activity immediately boosts the brainâ€™s dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levelsâ€”all of which affect focus and attention. In this way, exercise works in much the same way as ADHD medications such as Ritalin and Adderall.  Exercise and PTSD and trauma  Evidence suggests that by really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise, you can actually help your nervous system become â€œunstuckâ€ and begin to move out of the immobilization stress response that characterizes PTSD or trauma. Instead of thinking about other things, pay close attention to the physical sensations in your joints and muscles, even your insides as your body moves. Exercises that involve cross movement and that engage both arms and legsâ€”such as walking (especially in sand), running, swimming, weight training, or dancingâ€”are some of your best choices.  Outdoor activities like hiking, sailing, mountain biking, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, and skiing (downhill and cross-country) have also been shown to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.  Other mental and emotional benefits of exercise  Sharper memory and thinking. The same endorphins that make you feel better also help you concentrate and feel mentally sharp for tasks at hand. Exercise also stimulates the growth of new brain cells and helps prevent age-related decline.  Higher self-esteem. Regular activity is an investment in your mind, body, and soul. When it becomes habit, it can foster your sense of self-worth and make you feel strong and powerful. Youâ€™ll feel better about your appearance and, by meeting even small exercise goals, youâ€™ll feel a sense of achievement.  Better sleep. Even short bursts of exercise in the morning or afternoon can help regulate your sleep patterns. If you prefer to exercise at night, relaxing exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching can help promote sleep.  More energy. Increasing your heart rate several times a week will give you more get-up-and-go. Start off with just a few minutes of exercise a day, and increase your workout as you feel more energized.  Stronger resilience. When faced with mental or emotional challenges in life, exercise can help you cope in a healthy way, instead of resorting to alcohol, drugs, or other negative behaviors that ultimately only make your symptoms worse. Regular exercise can also help boost your immune system and reduce the impact of stress.  Reaping the mental health benefits of exercise is easier than you think Wondering just how active you need to be to get a mental health boost? Itâ€™s probably not as much as you think. You donâ€™t need to devote hours out of your busy day, train at the gym, sweat buckets, or run mile after monotonous mile. You can reap all the physical and mental health benefits of exercise with 30-minutes of moderate exercise five times a week. Two 15-minute or even three 10-minute exercise sessions can also work just as well.  Even a little bit of activity is better than nothing  If that still seems intimidating, donâ€™t despair. Even just a few minutes of physical activity are better than none at all. If you donâ€™t have time for 15 or 30 minutes of exercise, or if your body tells you to take a break after 5 or 10 minutes, for example, thatâ€™s okay, too. Start with 5- or 10-minute sessions and slowly increase your time. The more you exercise, the more energy youâ€™ll have, so eventually youâ€™ll feel ready for a little more. The key is to commit to do some moderate physical activityâ€”however littleâ€”on most days. As exercising becomes habit, you can slowly add extra minutes or try different types of activities. If you keep at it, the benefits of exercise will begin to pay off.  Can\'t find time to exercise during the week? Be a weekend warrior  A recent study in the UK found that people who squeeze their exercise routines into one or two sessions at the weekend experience almost as many health benefits as those who work out more often. So donâ€™t let a busy schedule at work, home, or school be an excuse to avoid activity. Get moving whenever you can find the timeâ€”your mind and body will thank you!  You don\'t have to suffer to get results  Research shows that moderate levels of exercise are best for most people. Moderate means:  That you breathe a little heavier than normal, but are not out of breath.  For example, you should be able to chat with your walking partner, but not easily sing a song. That your body feels warmer as you move, but not overheated or very sweaty. Overcoming mental health obstacles to exercise So now you know that exercise will help you feel much better and that it doesnâ€™t take as much effort as you might have thought. But taking that first step is still easier said than done. Exercise obstacles are very realâ€”particularly when youâ€™re also struggling with mental health. Here are some common barriers and what you can do to get past them.  Feeling exhausted. When youâ€™re tired or stressed, it feels like working out will just make it worse. But the truth is that physical activity is a powerful energizer. Studies show that regular exercise can dramatically reduce fatigue and increase your energy levels. If you are really feeling tired, promise yourself a 5-minute walk. Chances are youâ€™ll be able to go five more minutes.  Feeling overwhelmed. When youâ€™re stressed or depressed, the thought of adding another obligation can seem overwhelming. Working out just doesnâ€™t seem doable. If you have children, managing childcare while you exercise can be a big hurdle. Just remember that physical activity helps us do everything else better. If you begin thinking of physical activity as a priority, you will soon find ways to fit small amounts in a busy schedule.    Feeling hopeless. Even if youâ€™re starting at â€œground zero,â€ you can still workout. Exercise helps you get in shape. If you have no experience exercising, start slow with low-impact movement a few minutes each day.  Feeling pain. If you have a disability, severe weight problem, arthritis, or any injury or illness that limits your mobility, talk to your healthcare provider about ways to safely exercise. You shouldnâ€™t ignore pain, but rather do what you can, when you can. Divide your exercise into shorter, more frequent chunks of time if that helps, or try exercising in water to reduce joint or muscle discomfort.  Feeling bad about yourself. Are you your own worst critic? Itâ€™s time to try a new way of thinking about your body. No matter what your weight, age or fitness level, there are others like you with the goals of getting fit. Try surrounding yourself with people in your shoes. Take a class with people at a variety of fitness levels. Accomplishing even the smallest fitness goals will help you gain body confidence.  Getting started exercising when youâ€™re anxious or depressed Many of us find it hard enough to motivate ourselves to exercise at the best of times. When we feel depressed, anxious, stressed or have other mental or emotional problems, it can be doubly difficult. This is especially true of depression and anxiety, and it can leave you feeling trapped in a catch-22 situation. You know exercise will make you feel better, but depression has robbed you of the energy and motivation you need to exercise, or your social anxiety means you canâ€™t bear the thought of being seen at an exercise class or running through the park. So, what can you do?  It\'s okay to start small. In fact, it\'s smart.  When youâ€™re under the cloud of an emotional disorder and havenâ€™t exercised for a long time, setting yourself extravagant goals like completing a marathon or working out for an hour every morning will only leave you more despondent if you fall short. Better to set yourself achievable goals and build up from there.  Schedule your workout at the time of day when your energy is highest  That may be first thing in the morning before work or school, or at lunchtime before the mid-afternoon lull hits, or in longer sessions at the weekend. If depression or anxiety has you feeling tired and unmotivated all day long, try dancing to some music or simply going for a walk. Even a short, 15-minute walk can help clear your mind, improve your mood, and boost your energy level. As you move and start to feel a little better, youâ€™ll experience a greater sense of control over your well-being. You may even feel energized enough to exercise more vigorouslyâ€”by walking further, breaking into a run, or adding a bike ride, for example.  Other tips for staying motivated when youâ€™re also struggling with mental health  Focus on activities you enjoy. Any activity that gets you moving counts. That could include throwing a Frisbee with a dog or friend, walking laps of a mall window shopping, or cycling to the grocery store. If youâ€™ve never exercised before or donâ€™t know what you might enjoy, try a few different things. Activities such as gardening or tackling a home improvement project can be great ways to start moving more when you have a mood disorderâ€”as well as helping you become more active, they can also leave you with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.  Be comfortable. Whatever time of day you decide to exercise, wear clothing thatâ€™s comfortable and choose a setting that you find calming or energizing. That may be a quiet corner of your home, a scenic path, or your favorite city park.  Reward yourself. Part of the reward of completing an activity is how much better youâ€™ll feel afterwards, but it always helps your motivation to promise yourself an extra treat for exercising. Reward yourself with a hot bubble bath after a workout, a delicious smoothie, or with an extra episode of your favorite TV show.  Make exercise a social activity. Exercising with a friend or loved one, or even your kids will not only make exercising more fun and enjoyable, it can also help to motivate you to stick to a workout routine. Youâ€™ll also feel better than exercising alone. In fact, when youâ€™re suffering from a mood disorder such as depression, the companionship can be just as important as the exercise.  Easy ways to move more that don\'t involve the gym Donâ€™t have 30 minutes to dedicate to yoga or a bike ride? Donâ€™t worry. Think about physical activity as a lifestyle rather than just a single task to check off. Look at your daily routine and consider ways to sneak in activity here, there, and everywhere. Need ideas? Weâ€™ve got them.  In and around your home. Clean the house, wash the car, tend to the yard and garden, mow the lawn with a push mower, sweep the sidewalk or patio with a broom.  At work and on the go.

You donâ€™t have to worry about your breakfast\'s feelings, whether your lunch loves you or if your dinner is about to break up with you. But many people struggle with an unhealthy relationship with food and dieting, says Erin Clifford, a wellness coach based in Chicago. For some, that involves cheating on a diet by secretly consuming such diet-busting foods as chocolate chip cookies, muffins, ice cream, fried chicken and hamburgers.  â€œIâ€™ve worked with people who would bring me their food journal, and it looked perfect, but they werenâ€™t losing weight,â€ Clifford says. â€œI [would] ask, whatâ€™s really going on? And theyâ€™d admit they ate food they didnâ€™t put in the journal. Some people hide what theyâ€™re eating from their loved ones. I had one client who had a drawer hidden in her bathroom that her husband didnâ€™t know about. She used it to store things like cookies and potato chips. If youâ€™re hiding what youâ€™re eating, thatâ€™s not a healthy relationship with food.â€  Yo-yo dieting is another way an unhealthy relationship with food manifests itself. Some people can be on top of their diet game for weeks or months at a time, then relapse and gain weight by eating sugary, fatty and high-caloric items. â€œThatâ€™s not good for your body,â€ Clifford says. â€œIf you are constantly going up and down 5 pounds, thatâ€™s not good for your digestive system or your metabolism. Your body doesnâ€™t know what to do. We function best when weâ€™re eating in moderation and are consistent.â€ Some people eat emotionally to insulate themselves from their feelings, which is detrimental to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and losing unwanted pounds. People sometimes eat because they are stressed, sad, bored or lonely. People who eat emotionally typically reach for unhealthy â€œcomfort food,â€ such as ice cream or french fries, which can lead to obesity, diabetes and heart disease.  Then there are people addicted to food, often unhealthy things such as chocolate, pizza and snack chips. â€œSome people [are compulsive] about food, the same way some are about alcohol or gambling,â€ Clifford says. â€œThere are parallels.â€  But a food compulsion is different from other disorders. There are rehab centers and 12-step programs for alcoholism and gambling, but everyone needs to eat. Experts offer these tips to achieve and maintain healthy eating habits and avoid having food become an adversary or a too-close friend:  1. Don\'t label specific foods as good or bad. A cup of broccoli does not have angelic health powers, and a slice of pizza is not demonic. Some foods are better for your well-being than others, but no food is either evil or benevolent, says Anne Lewis, clinical psychologist at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis.  Ascribing moral qualities to foods gives them unwarranted power, Lewis says. If you deviate from your diet and eat junk food, that doesn\'t make you a bad person, and you needn\'t beat yourself up over it, which could lead to a sense of defeat and overeating. Maintain a healthy perspective on food by understanding that some foods are better for your health than others, but no single type of food or portion will ensure or ruin your well-being.  2. Minimize your opportunities to make bad choices. If you\'re on a low-sugar diet, itâ€™s OK to have a small piece of cake on special occasions, such as your birthday or when you\'re out having dinner with friends, Lewis says.  Limit your cake consumption to unusual events. Donâ€™t keep cake in the home â€“ keeping certain foods nearby can promote a habit of eating them, Lewis says. If you have a birthday celebration in your home and have leftover cake, give it away or throw it out. 3. Donâ€™t get too restrictive. Rather than cutting out certain foods completely, allow yourself one day a week to have a modest portion of your favorite treat. For example, instead of trying to banish donuts forever from your diet, permit yourself one every seven days, Clifford says.  Trying to never eat a particular food for the rest of your life might be unrealistic. Rather than feeling like a failure if you have that food â€“ which could lead to more binge eating â€“ incorporate that food into your eating routine in moderation.  4. Keep a food journal. Write down not only what you eat, but what you\'re feeling at the time. Documenting your eating habits and emotions will help you detect patterns, Clifford advises.  You might see that you backslide from your good eating habits by consuming chips, cookies or other junk foods when you\'re feeling sad, anxious or depressed. Rather than reaching for the unhealthy snack, try doing some deep breathing or going for a short walk. â€œIf you try that instead, a lot of times the craving will pass,â€ Clifford says.', 'healthydiet.jpg', 1, '6-strategies-for-health', 0, 'Prof. San', '2017-09-03 12:27:14', 'Prof. San', '2017-09-03 12:28:46'),
